# Headless Coderex: the daemon + CLI, no GUI.
#
#   brew install coderex
#
# This is the SAME `coderex` binary that ships inside Coderex.app, published
# standalone so a server, a CI box, or anyone who just wants the control surface
# can have it without the desktop app. It pairs with the cask (Casks/coderex.rb),
# which installs the GUI; the two can be installed together.
#
# `version` and `sha256` are rewritten automatically by the `homebrew` job in
# coderex-client/.github/workflows/release.yml. Keep both at two-space indentation
# — that job anchors its sed on `^  version ` / `^  sha256 `.

      Start the headless daemon with:
        coderex serve            # local socket only
        coderex serve --remote   # also join the end-to-end-encrypted relay

      The desktop app is a separate cask:
        brew install --cask coderex
    EOS

    assert_match version.to_s, shell_output("#{bin}/coderex --version")
    # With no daemon running this must fail cleanly rather than hang.
